title: 'This is the First and Last Post This Blog Will Receive'

Every dev makes a blog at some point to prove that they can, and to give thoughts on different matters. Almost every single dev also abandons the blog, or updates it once a year or something. Therefore, I shall make no such promises.

This blog will have this post. And only this post. I will make no promises about updating this blog. In fact, I will make the opposite. I promise to not update this blog as I do not have many thoughts regarding current events in coding that are worth reading. Here, in 2024:

AI is a gimmick and I think most features that have resulted from it so far are borderline unusable and unreliable. Which goes antithesis to everything I think software should be. It's pretty cool for visual stuff, mainly photos right now and I think in that direction it can become quite impressive. Maybe this opinion will age like milk, who knows.

This blog was made using the next.js blog tutorial, using gray-matter to parse a markdown file into a form that can be placed in an html and therefore loaded onto the website.

It is of course statically loaded, like I think every page will be on this website.

This website is my landing page leading to my personal information and projects that I do. This blog was made to prove "I can do this" and nothing more.
