# Personal website created with Next.js using Tailwind CSS

I wanted to make a personal website landing page with links that can lead to sites and apps hosted on my home server without needing to pay for a domain service. Because apparently spending 200+ and more on electricity every month on my server was perfectly fine, but 10$ a year (on the high end) on a domain name left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know.

## URL

[jacob-website-gray.vercel.app](https://jacob-website-gray.vercel.app/)

## Notes

This website had its stylings heavily inspired from the steam workshop, because it made me laugh. All implemented using Tailwind CSS.

The banner was taken from [Waneela](https://x.com/waneella_?lang=en) with the text edited by me

## Cool Stuff (Aka future planned features)

### Server Heartbeat Tracker

The website will have a heartbeat checker on my server, so that I can tell when the thing is alive or if it died because the power in my area is horrifically unreliable. When that is down, it closes links to apps hosted on the server that wouldn't work anyways, making them unclickable.

### Various Projects

This is my main landing page, so some projects are hosted on AWS or Azure or Google Cloud Hosting to show people that I've worked with them. Anything truly intensive will be hosted on my server. It has been proving paying for a domain name is beyond me, so why would paying any of those companies to host random apps I make be a thing?

### Procedurally Generated Banner

An idea from Greg Dan III is to make a procedurally generated banner in the same patterns as the one I currently have so that I'm not yoinking other's art and can have another cool project. This does sound cool and will definitely be worked on at some point following completion of the initial website.
